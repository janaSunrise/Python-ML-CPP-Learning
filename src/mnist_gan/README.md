# DCGAN using Pytorch C++

This contains Convolutional GAN to generate MNIST handwritten digit images. To run the code, 
Instructions are given in the main README.md file.

The training script periodically generates image samples. Use the `display_samples.py` script in this folder to generate a plot image. Use the following command to do so.

```sh
python display_samples.py -i dcgan-sample-10.pt
```
